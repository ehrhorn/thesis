\section{Monte Carlo simulation}\label{sec:monte_carlo_simulation}

Because the nature of quantum mechanics is probabilistic, simple, analytical calculations rarely suffice for theoretical predictions in high energy physics (HEP).
In order to develop a reconstruction algorithm, one needs to be able to test the algorithm on labelled data; should the algorithm be of the machine learning variety, this data is even integral to the development of the algorithm, as we have seen.

The HEP community relies on the Monte Carlo (MC) method for this.
The canonical introduction to MC is that of the calculation---or, more correctly, the approximation---of \( \pi \):
draw a circle inside a square, uniformly scatter points on the square, take the ratio of points inside the circle to total number of points scattered (and multiply by four).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./images/data/mc_pi.pgf}
    \caption{Two runs of the \( \pi \) MC algorithm with \num{100} samples on the left, \num{5000} samples on the right.
    The points outside the circle are colored red, while the points inside are colored blue.
    The shape of the circle is easily seen on the right, where the error in calculating \( \pi \) is around \( \SI{0.025}{\percent} \).}\label{fig:mc_pi}
\end{figure}

The requirement of uniformity is important, as else the distribution will be skewed and the calculation wrong.
As seen in~\vref{fig:mc_pi} the number of points also plays a role; the more points, the better the approximation, which seems intuitive enough.
This translates to particle physics rather well.
Generally, observables in particle physics take the form of~\cite{Weinzierl2000}
\begin{equation}
	O = \int \dl \Phi_{n}{\left( p_{a} + p_{b}, p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n} \right)} \frac{\lvert \mathcal{M} \rvert^2}{8 K(s)} \Theta{\left( O, p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n} \right)},
\end{equation}
with \( n \) outgoing particles from a collision between \( a \) and \( b \), where \( \dl \Phi_{n} \) is the Lorentz invariant phase space, \( \sfrac{1}{8 K(s)} \) is a kinematical factor, \( \mathcal{M} \) is the familiar matrix element and \( \Theta \) is a function defining the observable and experimental cuts.
The matrix element can be calculated, as discussed in~\vref{sec:the_standard_model}\footnote{There are complications as there are higher-order Feynman diagrams; some can be calculated perturbatively, others cannot and must be solved in different ways.}, and the phase space is then up to MC methods to solve.

The nuts and bolts are not important for this short discussion, but the long and short of it is that the final state momenta from the collision can be generated from re-expressing the phase space and inserting uniformly randomly generated numbers; rather like the approximation of \( \pi \).

While this handles the event generation part of the equation, simulation is needed afterwards to simulate properties of materials etc.

\section{Distributions and selections}\label{sec:distributions_and_selections}

The source of the data used is I3 files, as detailed in~\vref{sec:i3_file_format}, and moved to SQLite (\vref{sec:sqlite}) for training.
It is structured in features and truth, where the features represent detector data (simulated for MC) and the truth is the truth variables from the MC generator.

The detector data contains 13 distinct features (and two cleaning states), extracted from the I3 files, while the truth contains 12.
It should be noted that in~\cite{Molvig2020} feature engineering on the same dataset was attempted, resulting in no gains, and so is not re-applied here.

Some features---the string number, DOM number, PMT number and PMT type---are not used for training, but have been useful for analysis purposes, while the directional PMT features are only useful for Upgrade purposes (in that for DeepCore, the values are always the same (\( \left[0, 0, 1 \right] \))) because all PMTs point downwards.

In the end, the problem is one of converting 6 or 9 features into an output.

In the following, the ISO convention of spherical coordinate systems is used such that \( \theta \) refers to the zenith angle, and \( \phi \) the azimuthal angle.

\section{SQLite}\label{sec:sqlite}

As laid out in~\vref{sec:i3_file_format}, the IceCube native file format is not appropriate for machine learning applications.
Thus another format had to be used for the occasion.
First HDF5 was used.
HDF5 is a hierarchical data format, containing \enquote{Datasets} and \enquote{Groups}.
Datasets are arrays, similar to those of NumPy, containing data of a single type and a rectangular shape, and Groups are containers whereby the file is organized.
The format seems to be very popular in the scientific setting, but lacks a truly native Python library (i.e.\ a library that does not need to be externally installed), and does not seem to have a simple query language attached to it.
Furthermore, performance issues were encountered when more than 6 features were to be extracted at a time, and so alternatives were explored rather early in the process.

The choice soon felt on \verb|pickle| files, with the inspiration coming from typical ML image applications.
Here, it is typical to organize image files in folders: in a classification task, where an algorithm must learn to classify cats and dogs, the images may be organized as follows:
\dirtree{%
.1 training.
.2 cat.
.2 dog.
.1 test.
.2 cat.
.2 dog.
}
\begin{listing}
	\inputminted{python}{./images/data/pickle_example.py}
	\caption{An example of an event in Python dictionary form.
	The data has been transformed by a robust scaler, as detailed in~\vref{sec:data_transformation}.}\label{listing:pickle_example}
\end{listing}
This was extended to the problem at hand, with each event being saved as Python dictionaries in \verb|pickle| files, named by event number, such that one event might look as in~\vref{listing:pickle_example}.
\verb|pickle| is Pythons format for serializing objects, meaning one can save any Python object to disk with it.
This proved to be a very efficient solution in training, as opening pickle files is an embarrassingly parallel problem, and it can be done very quickly even in Python.

However, the structure presented a problem: dealing with millions of events means dealing with millions of files, and performance degraded significantly on other tasks.
As an example, the datasets were created on an HPC cluster with no access to GPUs.
Therefore, the sets had to be transferred to an external machine containing GPUs, and this was not easily done using standard tools such as \verb|rsync|.
\verb|tar| was employed, but the act of taring, transferring, and untaring was tedious, and would become a problem if new datasets were to be created as it hindered fast application of new ideas.

The dataset was then converted into \verb|shelve|, a Python native persistent database which can hold as values arbitrary Python objects, such as dictionaries.
Each key was then an event number, and its value event information; as in~\vref{listing:pickle_example}.
Performance was unfortunately found to be so bad as to be unusable, and so finally SQLite was discussed.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language for querying relational databases, invented in 1974.
Its use is very common in the private sector, and SQLite specifically claims to be the most prevalent database in use at the moment\footnote{\url{https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html}}.
The reason for this seems to be the fact that most---if not all---languages have baked-in support, and whereas most other relational databases work in a client-server fashion, SQLite is file-oriented.
This means it is easy, if not downright trivial, to package a database in e.g.\ a mobile application.

It does not seem to this author that SQLite has gained any traction in the ML community.
Indeed, most example regression tasks found on the internet contains data in CSV files, or maybe in the NPY format, but as datasets get bigger, both of these are bad choices.
Besides the fact that CSV is a text file, and so suffers from the problems laid out in~\vref{sec:i3_file_format}, both formats need to be loaded completely into memory on reading, and this can quickly run into memory capacity issues.
SQLite, on the other hand, is opened with a connection, and data is not fetched until a query is actually run.
This allows the dataset contained in the SQLite file to be of arbitrary size (limited by file system and other externalities) with no memory impact; you simply fetch the training events you want at runtime.
This is aided by the fact that SQLite uses B-trees to index its rows: a relational database, SQLite included, organizes the data in two-dimensional tables, and optimizes the search time by employing unique indices.
In lieu of an index, a search in a table would run in linear time, because the program would have to search through each row until the wanted index is found.
Binary search algorithms changes this to logarithmic time, \( \mathcal{O}(\log{n}) \) (with \( n \) the number of entries), by sorting the index and checking the middle element; if this element is not equal to the wanted index, the half where the index cannot be found is discarded, and the algorithm run again.
B-trees is a general structure that can implement binary search efficiently, and thus allows SQLite to fetch indices in logarithmic time.

However, the IceCube data does not immediately lend itself to this structure.
As can be seen from~\vref{listing:pickle_example} the features are of shape \( M \times N \) where \( M \) is the length of the event and \( N \) the number of features, while the truth labels are of size \( 1 \times P \) with \( P \) the number of labels.
The natural database would accommodate this, and there exists solutions that, called NoSQL, which hold data in a JSON-like format.
However, no widespread format was found that is file-oriented instead of client-server, a requirement for portability; thus SQLite was settled on.
Each row in the truth table has a unique event number as its primary key, while each event (spread over several rows) in the features table has the same event number.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./images/data/diagram.png}
    \caption{The structure of a dataset, with the features table holding (MC) detector data from events, and the truth table holding the (MC) particle truth variables.}\label{fig:sql_diagram_1}
\end{figure}

The structure can be seen in SQL diagram form in~\vref{fig:sql_diagram_1}.

More intangible benefits derive from using SQLite.
First of all, SQLite supports SQL.\@
This means that one is able to search easily in databases using clauses to narrow the search, and this aids tremendously in analyzing the data and making cuts, for example.
For example, \mint{sql}|select event_no from truth where energy_log10 between 1.0 and 2.0| would give all event numbers where \( \log_{10}{\left( E_{\text{truth}} \right)} \) is between 1 and 2.
Another thing, which is not immediately obvious, is the fact that SQL databases enjoy extremely wide app support.
This means that there's a large selection of apps (free and otherwise) that allow querying and visualization of the database, an extremely nice feature.

Because IceCube has an abundance of data and MC files, from different analysis groups, and different generators, it was infeasible to gather all data in one SQLite dataset.
Therefore, a solution was implemented by the author, wherein one database contains meta info from all available IceCube files.
This has many advantages.
Firstly, it provides one central repository for everyone doing machine learning on IceCube.
This means there is one source of truth for event numbers, meaning everyone can agree on what data is used for training, and what is to be blinded and used for test.
Secondly, it facilitates quick iteration, by allowing the user to create different sets quickly with different cuts, without the size of the database being to large to be portable.

Code for this, called \enquote{CubeDB}, can be found on Github at \url{https://github.com/ehrhorn/cubedb}, created by the author.
This code relies on the I3 files being available, but should otherwise be able to run on all machines that have Docker or Singularity installed, facilitated by a compiled Docker image that includes all IceCube software necessary to fetch data from I3 files.
CubeDB takes a SQL query as an argument, and uses this to select events from I3 files and builds a SQLite dataset from it.
It also contains scripts for building a meta database, and thus is ready to be implemented should a group wish to do so\footnote{The solution does need documenting and tests, however}, and the software is already in use at the Niels Bohr Institute by at least one other person pursuing IceCube machine learning.

It is not hard to imagine a \enquote{professional} workflow for the implementation of this solution; the meta database could run on a true SQL server, accessible via (protected) API calls, while the dataset creation tool CubeDB could run on a generic web server with access to all I3 files contained in the meta database.
A GUI for CubeDB can be built using web technology, which would allow IceCube ML researchers to easily \enquote{order} the creation of a new dataset to be delivered to some shared disk location.
In any case, much of the development of this thesis centered on CubeDB, because there is no default solution in IceCube for this, meaning \textit{any} solution would be of immense benefit to new students starting an ML project; a central source of truth on event numbers and training samples/test samples would also be very valuable, and both can be provided by CubeDB.\@
