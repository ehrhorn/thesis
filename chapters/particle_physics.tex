The fact that neutrinos oscillate is one of the more exciting findings in particle physics.
Because it points to something we cannot explain, namely that neutrinos have non-zero mass, researching this phenomenon might open the window into new physics beyond the Standard Model, much as the ultraviolet catastrophe led to quantum mechanics and the lack of evidence for a luminiferous aether led to relativity.

In the following we shall start by introducing said model, briefly touch on the weak interaction, and explain the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations and what problems it may help solve.
