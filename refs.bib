	abstract = {The {IceCube} Neutrino Observatory at the geographic South Pole has reached a number of milestones in the field of neutrino astrophysics. The achievements of {IceCube} include the discovery of a high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux, and the temporal and directional correlation of neutrinos with a flaring blazar. The {IceCube} Upgrade, which will be constructed in the 2022/23 Antarctic Summer season, is the next stage of the {IceCube} project. The {IceCube} Upgrade consists of seven new columns of photosensors, densely embedded near the bottom center of the existing cubic-kilometer-scale {IceCube} Neutrino Observatory. An improved atmospheric neutrino event selection efficiency and reconstruction at a few {GeV} can be achieved with the dense infill of the Upgrade's photosensor array. The Upgrade will provide world-leading sensitivity to neutrino oscillations and will enable {IceCube} to take unique measurements of tau neutrino appearance with a high precision. Furthermore, the new array will also improve the existing {IceCube} detector. The Upgrade strings will include new calibration devices designed to deepen the knowledge of the optical properties of glacial ice and the detector response. The improved calibration resulting from the Upgrade will be applied to the entire archive of {IceCube} data collected over the last 10 years, improving the angular and spatial resolution of the detected astrophysical neutrino events. Finally, the Upgrade represents the first stage in the development of {IceCube}-Gen2, the next-generation neutrino telescope at the South Pole.},

We also comment on recent attempts to account for these results and to understand flavour from first principles. We discuss extensively the prospects for probing the strength of {CP} violation in two near term accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments, T2K and {NOvA}, as well as possible extensions such as T2KK and a second large off-axis detector near the {NOvA} detector. We also briefly discuss the possibility of probing the effect of Majorana phases in future neutrinoless double beta decay searches and discuss other implications of leptonic {CP} violation such as leptogenesis. Finally we comment on the issue of robustness of the current oscillation interpretation and possible ways of probing for non-standard neutrino interactions in precision oscillation studies.},

	abstract = {Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ({WIMPs}) are well-motivated candidates for Dark Matter ({DM}). {WIMP} models often include self-annihilation into Standard Model particles such as neutrinos which could potentially be detected by the {IceCube} Neutrino Observatory. Various searches for a dark matter induced signal have been performed with the existing {IceCube} detector. However, since there is so far no evidence for {WIMPs} at {TeV} scales, more attention is brought to {DM} candidates at {GeV} masses, for which the {IceCube} detector is not sensitive due to its energy threshold. The {IceCube} collaboration is currently preparing the construction of the {IceCube} Upgrade which is planned to be deployed in the 2022/2023 South Pole summer season. The {IceCube} Upgrade will consist of 7 new in-ice strings with about 700 additional optical sensors. This dense sensor array inside the {IceCube}-{DeepCore} volume will enhance the reconstruction capability of few-{GeV} neutrinos. We present first studies on the potential improvements of this upgrade on {IceCube}'s sensitivity to Dark Matter annihilating in the Galactic Center.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results from point-like neutrino source searches using ten years of {IceCube} data collected between Apr.{\textasciitilde}6, 2008 and Jul.{\textasciitilde}10, 2018. We evaluate the significance of an astrophysical signal from a point-like source looking for an excess of clustered neutrino events with energies typically above \${\textbackslash}sim1{\textbackslash},\${TeV} among the background of atmospheric muons and neutrinos. We perform a full-sky scan, a search within a selected source catalog, a catalog population study, and three stacked Galactic catalog searches. The most significant point in the Northern hemisphere from scanning the sky is coincident with the Seyfert {II} galaxy {NGC} 1068, which was included in the source catalog search. The excess at the coordinates of {NGC} 1068 is inconsistent with background expectations at the level of \$2.9{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$ after accounting for statistical trials. The combination of this result along with excesses observed at the coordinates of three other sources, including {TXS} 0506+056, suggests that, collectively, correlations with sources in the Northern catalog are inconsistent with background at 3.3\${\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance. These results, all based on searches for a cumulative neutrino signal integrated over the ten years of available data, motivate further study of these and similar sources, including time-dependent analyses, multimessenger correlations, and the possibility of stronger evidence with coming upgrades to the detector.},

	abstract = {{IceCube} was completed in December 2010. It forms a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of {\textasciitilde} 1 cubic km in the deep Antarctic ice for particle induced photons. The telescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 {GeV}. Owing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates are particularly low. Hence {IceCube} can also detect large numbers of {MeV} neutrinos by observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the dark noise. With 2 ms timing resolution, {IceCube} can track subtle features in the temporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. For a supernova at the galactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-free megaton-scale supernova search experiment. The sensitivity decreases to 20 standard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations at the Large Magellanic Cloud (50 kpc). {IceCube} is sending triggers from potential supernovae to the Supernova Early Warning System. The sensitivity to neutrino properties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed and simulations of tantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black hole as well as the characteristics of shock waves are presented. All results are preliminary.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, we have seen fundamental breakthroughs in core problems in machine learning, largely driven by advances in deep neural networks. At the same time, the amount of data collected in a wide array of scientific domains is dramatically increasing in both size and complexity. Taken together, this suggests many exciting opportunities for deep learning applications in scientific settings. But a significant challenge to this is simply knowing where to start. The sheer breadth and diversity of different deep learning techniques makes it difficult to determine what scientific problems might be most amenable to these methods, or which specific combination of methods might offer the most promising first approach. In this survey, we focus on addressing this central issue, providing an overview of many widely used deep learning models, spanning visual, sequential and graph structured data, associated tasks and different training methods, along with techniques to use deep learning with less data and better interpret these complex models --- two central considerations for many scientific use cases. We also include overviews of the full design process, implementation tips, and links to a plethora of tutorials, research summaries and open-sourced deep learning pipelines and pretrained models, developed by the community. We hope that this survey will help accelerate the use of deep learning across different scientific domains.},

Yet recent results indicate that convolutional architectures can outperform recurrent networks on tasks such as audio synthesis and machine translation. Given a new sequence modeling task or dataset, which architecture should one use? We conduct a systematic evaluation of generic convolutional and recurrent architectures for sequence modeling. The models are evaluated across a broad range of standard tasks that are commonly used to benchmark recurrent networks. Our results indicate that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as {LSTMs} across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer effective memory. We conclude that the common association between sequence modeling and recurrent networks should be reconsidered, and convolutional networks should be regarded as a natural starting point for sequence modeling tasks.
